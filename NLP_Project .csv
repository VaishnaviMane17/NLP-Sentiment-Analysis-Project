07/24/2019,2019,Mumbai,English,Mumbai Mirror,Farming and climate change ,"An economic survey noted that the average income of a farmer is Rs 20,000 a year 
By Parth M.N. 
Only sincere efforts and investment on part of the government can help our beleaguered farmers 
According to data from the agriculture ministry, the month of June recorded deficient to scanty rainfall in 31out of 36 subdivisions of India. It has grossly affected the sowing process of farmers, which sets the tone for the rest of the season. 
But the ministry’s figures pegged the total area under plantation by the end of June at 146.61lakh hectares. Same time, last year, the number stood at 162.07 lakh hectares, noting a 10 per cent drop. The decline against the five-year average is even steeper. At 196.66 lakh hectares, June 2019 recorded a 25 per cent decrease in sowing area. 
One of the worst sufferers is the state of Maharashtra, which has merely recorded 54 per cent sowing even after three weeks of July, when ideally it should have happened by mid-June. But the monsoon hit the state on June 25, and has still been erratic since. 
I was in Latur last week, where I met several farmers who had stayed away from sowing their kharif crops. “We knew of water scarcity in summers,” they said. “But we are now getting used to water scarcity during 
monsoons.” 
Maharashtra’s total live capacity at the full reservoir level is 14.07 BCM. As of July 18 this year, it was 2.78 BCM, or 20 per cent of its water level. Same time, last year, the number stood at 5.59 BCM, double of what we have today. 
In the past five years or so, Maharashtra has witnessed a cruel pattern where the rain gods desert the state with 15-20 day dry spells after promising initial showers. Farmers carry out sowing, hoping the initial patterns persist, and a dry spell brings it back to naught. I met an 80-year old farmer to understand how the rainfall patterns have thrown farmers off. “In the 20th century, by and large, we had 70-80 days of rainfall,” he said. “It used to drizzle, consistently and peacefully. Today, we hardly have 40 days of rainfall, and when it rains, it lashes down. We cannot farm in this weather. It devours the investment, and we have to risk another round of sowing, increasing the production cost. It seems like a waste with each passing year.” 
His words reflect the mood of farmers across the state. Merely 26 per cent of Kokan’s sowing area is under cultivation, while Latur region stands at 45 per cent, and Nagpur region at 41per cent. Many of the farmers may still plant crops, but several are likely to stay away entirely from this year’s kharif season. 
The above percentages may give a broader picture, but they do not convey the inequality and eccentricity of the sowing pattern. In Latur, which shows 45 per cent sowing, there are talukas with 5 per cent to 60 per cent of sowing. 
Observers say the sowing has been getting delayed almost every year now, and it has an adverse impact on the farmer’s productivity. 
Atul Deulgaonkar, an environmental journalist based in Latur, said the government has to look at crop pattern and its adaptability according to the change in weather patterns. “We need to invest in research that is local specific, because each region has its own quirks,” he said. “If the monsoon is shrinking, should we be investing in crops that are harvested in two-three months? Australia and China have developed certain perennial crops that do not deteriorate for five years, taking away the pressures that come with sowing. The government has to take the initiative, because farmers are at the passive end of this.” 
Bangladesh, which endures consistent floods, has developed scuba rice to survive them. Deulgaonkar, expounding on that example, said, “Beirut has developed the kind of wheat that sustains 50 degrees Celsius. We need to come up with something depending on our climate patterns.” 
That would require sincere efforts, and investment on part of the government. But farmers’ sustainability does not seem to be on top of our priorities. The economic survey of 2018 predicts that climate change influencing agricultural productivity patterns could reduce agriculture incomes by 15-18 per cent annually. The same economic survey of 2016-17 noted the average income of a farmer in 17 states in India is Rs 20,000 a year. Now do the math."
10/15/2019,2019,Mumbai,English,Mumbai Mirror,Children as champions of climate change ,"Talk of coincidences and Bijal Vachharajani’s latest book for children, A Cloud Called Bhura, checks quite a few boxes. 
In the 256-pager, a UFO-sized, brown cloud hijacks the sky of Mumbai, leading to poor visibility, breathing problems and melting roads, and sending crows and kites to fly away, making hermit crabs disappear, and leaving the city with power cuts and food and water shortage. It forces people to stay mostly indoors, wear gas masks and goggles when they step out, and even migrate to North India. And when policy makers and politicians fail to take what scientists dub as a human-induced climate change seriously — and instead call it an ‘international conspiracy’ to malign the city — four school friends start The Silver Lining Abhiyan. They mobilise the youth of the country and file a petition in court against the Maharashtra government, asserting their constitutional right to a life without ‘Cloud Bhura’, while urging the state to restrict polluting companies and save public resources for the future. 
No, the book isn’t inspired by Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, or the millions of students she’s inspired in the recent past, to press for faster action on climate change. It’s purely coincidental, says the Bengaluru- based author and senior editor at Pratham Books. Vachharajani started writing this book in 2014, submitted it by 2017-end, much before Thunberg started her strikes and eventually reached the UN, and released it this August. “It is eerie to see that the world has really come to this now. I didn’t think children would take up the 

cudgels for climate advocacy, but, also it doesn’t surprise me in the least, because if anybody is going to make a difference, I feel it will be the children,” says the 40-year-old author. 
She thanks little champs, such as the 21 youngsters who’ve been fighting a lawsuit against the US government for denying them a stable climate; and Haridwar girl Ridhima Pandey, who, at the age of nine, sued the Indian government for disregarding environmental laws. And, because of their campaign, the author was able to find a practical ending to her book. “Climate change is not something you can simply wish away”, she says. In fact, every climate-related statement made by children in the last two chapters has been taken directly from students whom she spoke to during school visits. Such as, ‘We are sick of the lies — the lies that adults tell us’ or ‘You are taking away our future and there is no bigger crime than that’. 
The students’ climate movement has been criticised by some for being alarmist. Does Vachharajani feel her book has gone overboard too, even though it’s a work of fiction (with illustrations by Aindri C) but peppered with facts and laws? “Look at the world around — weather patterns are changing; my friends want to move out of Delhi because their children can’t breathe unpolluted air; I have waded through waist-deep water during Mumbai’s 26/7 floods. Or, read the new IPCC report summary (which says many cities, including Mumbai, might sink by 2100). So what I have written is not alarmist anymore, it’s fairly alarming,” argues Vachharajani. 
But why Mumbai? When one thinks of air pollution, Delhi tops the list. The writer, who grew up and worked in Mumbai, says familiarity was one reason. “Several articles have also written about Mumbai’s smog. But I have borrowed elements from other cities, such as the smog headaches of Delhi or the technical solutions and hackathons from Bengaluru.” 
The subject of climate advocacy came naturally to her. As a teenager, Vachharajani and her cousin would do street shows on Juhu Beach advocating non-violence, or do puppet shows, asking people not to throw trash in the open. Her 20s was about animal rights activism. In 2012, she went on to do a Master’s in Climate Change from the UN-mandated University for Peace in Costa Rica. And so, all her five books (one was co-authored) talk about the environment. “A Cloud Called Bhura was the first book I started writing but just like climate talks, it kept getting sidelined,” says “the certified climate worrier”. Her concern for the natural world was shaped by Enid Blyton books such as The Cherry Tree Farm, and The Magic Faraway Tree, and her mother who would bring home injured birds and kittens. 
For her next, she is interviewing 10 eco-stars working on coral bleaching, groundwater depletion, food security, wildlife and other fields. It will be a non-fiction book but yet again for children. “I am a cynical person but these children give me hope. So I place my confidence (for a better future) in the bachcha party, not buddha party,” says Vachharajani."
10/31/2019,2019,Mumbai,English,Mumbai Mirror,Mumbai could go under water by 2050,"International study gives new estimates on the impact of rising sea levels in major parts of the world. 
Mumbai is at risk of being submerged by 2050, according to an international study that gives new estimates on the impact of rising sea levels in major parts of the world. It suggests that by mid-century much of the southern parts of the city may sink at least once a year below the projected high tide line – the mark on coastal lands up to which the highest high tide reaches in a year. 
The research was published on Tuesday by New Jersey-based Climate Central, a non-profit news organisation comprising scientists and journalists who analyse and report on climate science. In a report based on the study, the New York Times said, “Built on what was a series of islands, the city’s (Mumbai’s) historic downtown core is particularly vulnerable.” The newspaper also published a series of predicted maps showing parts of Mumbai as well as Bangkok and Shanghai submerged. 
According to the study, nearly 250 million people around the world currently live on land that may go below water levels during annual floods. Out of these, 70 per cent live in Asian countries like India, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and Japan. 
Cautioning the coastal communities worldwide, the study’s researchers said people must prepare themselves for much more difficult times in the future than what is anticipated if current trends of greenhouse gas emissions continue. This would also mean huge populations would migrate to stay away from harm’s way, which could further exert pressure on economies. 
Using a form of artificial intelligence known as neural networks, the new research corrects ground elevation data that has up to now vastly underestimated the extent to which coastal zones are subject to flooding during high tide or major storms. 
“Sea-level projections have not changed,” said the study’s co-author Ben Strauss, adding, “But when we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas than we previously understood”. 
“Climate change has the potential to reshape cities, economies, coastlines and entire global regions within our lifetime,” said the study’s lead author Scott Kulp. He said, as the tideline rises higher than the ground people call home, nations will increasingly confront questions about whether, how much and how long coastal defences can protect them. 
Debi Goenka of city-based nongovernment organisation Conservation Action Trust said the findings of the report don’t surprise him. Goenka, who got a landmark order in 2005 for protection of mangroves, said he has been saying this for the past 25 years. “The report has just confirmed it. It is all very well for our prime ministers and chief ministers to make statements about climate change at conferences, but what is needed is to address the issues,” he said. Goenka asked that if the city is going to be submerged by 2050 then do we still need to spend Rs 13,000 crore on a 10-km coastal road. “Or Rs 4,000 crore on a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji? Do we want to make an underground metro which is going to be underwater by 2050? Do we want to build another international airport which is vulnerable to submergence?” he asked, suggesting that the state government ideally be looking at planning to relocate Mumbai and Navi Mumbai to a new place in the state. “Ideally it should be located near Panvel at Panvel-Nashik-Oune triangle; reasonably far away and at a fair elevation,” he said. 
Anish Andheria of Wildlife Conservation Trust said sea levels are rising largely because of climate change. He said the mangroves are a frontline defence when it comes to the interface between the land and the sea. “There were seven islands and mangroves encircled them. If we had started building only where the mangroves ended then rise in sea levels would have never impacted us. In the current scenario of mangrove destruction, even a rise by one metre would destroy most of the city,” he said, adding that the solution on a global scale is to try and regrow the forests. “In India there is no respect for forests. What’s worse, in Mumbai, most wetlands and salt pan lands have been opened for development,” he said. 
Kedar Gore of the Corbett Foundation also didn’t find anything new in the data. He said it has already been projected by the IPCC panel of the UN. “But we have no respect for science and people who are warning us,” he said, adding that we need to ensure preserving whatever natural habitats remain. — With inputs from Linah Baliga"
06/05/2020,2020,Mumbai,English,Mumbai Mirror,"Clean air is our right: On Environment Day, climate activist Ridhima Pandey bats for healthy air through SaalBhar60 campaign","For over two months, the country has been under lockdown amid rising cases of COVID-19, but the one good thing that has happened is people are breathing cleaner and healthy air. 
Now, on the occasion of the environment day, SaalBhar60 campaign seeks people from Mumbai and across the country to join hands for clean and healthy air, in one of the largest digital campaigns. 
The campaign was launched by Haridwar-based Ridhima Pandey, the only young activist from India alongside Greta Thunberg who filed a complaint on climate Chnage to the UN child rights committee. 
To ensure a safe and healthy environment, the campaign demands that the government put in place measures to ensure that the PM 2.5 levels in cities are 60 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3), which is the safe limit (for 24 hours) as prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). 
Ridhima has urged citizens to participate in a nationwide digital movement by sharing their photos holding a placard saying ‘Clean Air for All’ and uploading it on Twitter by tagging Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. 
Speaking to Mirror Online, Ridhima said that the lockdown has brought a lot of positive changes in the country. ""The air, water, and even the rivers are getting cleaner. The Air Quality Index (AQI) level in several cities used to be above 100, now it has come to 60. For clean air, people should not have to wait for the lockdown. People should be able to breathe clean air and it is their right."" 
Ahead of World Environment Day, a letter to minister Prakash Javadekar with an appeal to protect Goa's protected forests 
On the eve of World Environment Day, conservation activists and concerned citizens have written to the Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, drawing his attention to at least three recent approvals given for development projects that they say will have severe and adverse impact on Goa's ecology. 
When asked if India is doing enough to tackle climate change, Ridhima said that there is not much concern about the environment. 
""I would not say India is doing much to combat climate change. Despite the lockdown, we have seen that environment clearances are being given for projects, it shows the concern the government has towards the environment. The government hasn't really seen what's happening around, if they are seeing it, they are ignoring. The clearances are being given without thinking about how bad it is going to be in the future. The rules and norms should be followed strictly and should take into consideration what scientists are saying."" 
The young activist says that people too have to change their lifestyle and the way they look at the environment. ""People in India are not much aware of climate change. They are not serious as they are less aware. They have to change their mindset."" 
""As compared to India,"" Ridhima says, ""People in most of the foreign countries are really aware of the environment. The first strike of my life was in New York where I saw people from all generations demanding change. They are following basic hygiene. They are not spitting anywhere or throwing garbage."" 
""We are doing our best to create awareness, however, we can't just go to someone who is violating rules. We don't have rights, but we have voices. Often, people don't like a child explaining to them something about the environment. Therefore, the government has an important role to play, they have power as they are policy makers."" 
Shikha Kumar of Jhatkaa.org said that while Mumbai witnessed clean air and blue skies in the lockdown period, it’s ironic that it came at the cost of a pandemic. 
Kumar said that the images received from people across India during the campaign will be compiled and a poster collage will be created, to be sent to the Environment Minister Prakash Javdekar and Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan as well as to Environment ministers of all the states. 
Children participate in clean air campaign. 
As per the data by Urban Emissions, Mumbai witnessed a major dip in PM 2.5, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) as well as PM10 levels during the lockdown period. 
A day after Cyclone Nisarga and the subsequent rains that lashed various parts of the metropolitan city, officials revealed that the cyclone was not that bad after all for Mumbai. In fact, it helped to improve Mumbai's air quality to the best its been so far this year. 
""It’s not possible once everything is back to normal that we simply abandon cars and shut industries to achieve clean air. However good and healthy air quality can be achieved with stricter policies and its stringent implementation, which is what Mumbai needs,"" he added."
11/25/2019,2019,Mumbai,English,NPR,Mangroves help fight the effects of climate change. So Why is Mumbai destroying them?,"Bare trees with slender branches line a half-built highway overpass in eastern Mumbai. These are mangroves, trees or shrubs found in tropical swampy marshland with roots that grow above the ground. But construction has blocked their lifeblood — salt water. Their aerial roots poke through dry, caked mud instead of brackish water.
Environmentalist B.N. Kumar points to a small channel under the highway where seawater once entered the mangrove patch. It's now littered with rocks and construction debris.
""All the mangroves, about 5,000 of them, have dried up. They can only be used as firewood now,"" Kumar says. ""It's very sad to see these mangroves dying like this.""
Thousands of acres of velvety green mangroves line the border between the Arabian sea and the city of Mumbai in western India. They act as natural buffers against coastal erosion and flooding, and they store up to four times as much carbon as other forests. With sea level rise inevitable, Mumbai's mangroves are more important now than ever. A new report by climate change researchers predicts much of Mumbai, which is India's financial capital, will be underwater by 2050 if global carbon emissions aren't reduced. The city, originally a cluster of seven islands, is especially vulnerable. Many parts of it have been built by reclaiming land from the sea.""At a time when we require more and more mangroves, we are destroying, unfortunately, more and more mangroves,"" Kumar says.
Studies show that Mumbai lost nearly 40 percent of its mangroves between 1991 and 2001 — about 9,000 acres. And rapid urbanization continues to threaten them.
A short car ride from the dried mangroves along the highway, a municipal garbage truck dumps trash on the edge of a mangrove patch. Sludge and plastic waste cover the roots of the mangroves, slowly choking them. In another area nearby, hundreds of acres of mangroves are being cut for the construction of the Navi Mumbai international airport.
One of India's most glamorous infrastructure projects, the country's first bullet train — which will run between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, in the western Indian state of Gujarat — is estimated to destroy at least 32,000 mangroves.
Journalist-turned-activist Kumar, who runs a blog called The Nature Connect, has raised concerns about mangrove destruction with authorities, including the Japanese government agency that is helping build the bullet train. Kumar and other activists organized an exhibition in Mumbai earlier this year displaying large posters about the environmental impacts of such projects.
Kumar says environmentalists are often branded as anti-development, especially when they oppose projects like the bullet train, which, for many Indians, is a source of pride.
""We are not against any development,"" Kumar says. ""Our question is, does it need to happen at the cost of the environment?""
People need to understand that they cannot survive without nature, says Debi Goenka, executive trustee of the Mumbai-based nonprofit Conservation Action Trust. ""Just chasing the mirage of GDP growth is not development,"" he adds.
Authorities say they will plant five mangroves for each one that is cut for the bullet train. But activists say promises about replanting are a sham.
""There is actually no land [within the city] to replant mangroves, no suitable habitat available,"" says Goenka. On the rare occasion that mangrove restoration does happen, most of the saplings don't survive, Goenka adds.
With these mangroves gone, Mumbai will be left without a vital line of defense when natural disasters strike. And that has happened before.
In 2005, when the city experienced unprecedented monsoon rainfall leading to catastrophic flooding, one of the worst affected areas was a commercial hub in central Mumbai, full of shopping malls and skyscrapers. It's been constructed by reclaiming low-lying areas on the banks of the Mithi River, previously home to a sprawling mangrove forest that acted as a natural stormwater drain.
While floods were ravaging most of Mumbai, Nandakumar Pawar recalls being surprised that his fishing village in a northeastern suburb of Mumbai escaped the worst. A more than 2,000-acre stretch of mangroves nearby acted as a sponge to hold water and didn't allow it to flood his village, he says.
""That was a truly eye-opening incident for me and my community,"" Pawar says.
As a fisherman, Pawar already knew mangroves are breeding grounds for fish, which lay their eggs on the roots. He realized mangroves were crucial not just for the fishing community but for everyone.
He started a nongovernmental group called Shree Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (named for a local deity) that has enlisted fishermen to help with mangrove and wetland conservation. When they go out to fish, they act as mangrove vigilantes. If they spot illegal activities, like debris or garbage dumping or illegal encroachment in mangrove areas, they alert the organization, Pawar says.

Authorities appear to be slowly realizing the urgency of mangrove conservation.
In 2012, the government in the state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, set up a mangrove conservation unit, the first in India. The unit helps regenerate mangroves through a variety of projects, explains former range forest officer Seema Adgaonkar, as she walks through a nursery she helped set up in a northeastern suburb of Mumbai. The gnarled roots of the mangroves rise out of damp, mossy earth and pools of tidal water.
Adgaonkar rattles off the names of mangrove species that used to found in the wild in Mumbai but can only be seen in a protected nursery now. It's part of the city's first mangrove and coastal biodiversity tourism center, which offers regular tours, including flamingo safaris, to heighten awareness.
The unit also deploys security officers armed with buckshot guns along the periphery of mangrove forests. The Bombay High Court ruled in 2018 that the destruction of mangroves ""offends the fundamental rights of citizens,"" and several people have been arrested, mostly for encroachment.
But a handful of officers of the mangrove cell are not enough to save all of Mumbai's mangroves, Adgaonkar says. It's important to educate the public — especially children — about the urgency of saving these indispensable trees, she adds.
""If mangroves are saved, Mumbai will be saved,"" Adgaonkar says. ""Otherwise, as sea levels rise, this bustling metropolis will collapse like a house of cards."""
09/03/2021,2021,Mumbai,English,Hindustan Times,"Since 2019, Maharashtra spent ₹ 14K-crore as compensation for extreme weather events","The number is, however, a gross underestimation of the total cost of recent climate disasters in the state, officials and experts pointed outSince 2019, Maharashtra has paid at least ₹14,000 crore – about 18% of the state’s fiscal deficit for financial year (FY) 2020-21 – as direct compensation to those affected by extreme weather events. This figure was brought out in a presentation made to the state cabinet on Wednesday by the environment department to highlight concerns raised in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) sixth assessment report released last month.The number is, however, a gross underestimation of the total cost of recent climate disasters in the state, officials and experts pointed out.A government official privy to the development, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The numbers presented to the state cabinet are an overview of the most prominent disasters since 2019, such as Cyclones Kyarr, Nisarga and Tauktae, last year’s floods in Vidarbha and the recent Konkan floods. An amount of ₹14,000 crore was the outlay in compensation that was directly paid toward the rehabilitation of affected persons. The real cost of the disasters is of course much higher because a lot of money has to also be allocated toward infrastructure repairs.”Last year alone, Maharashtra paid about ₹5,500 crore as compensation for extreme weather events, including hail storms, unseasonal rainfall, extended monsoon rainfall, cyclone, heat waves, lightning and cold waves, data obtained from the state disaster management authority and the environment and the climate change department has revealed.Most of this amount was disbursed to farmers for agricultural damages – losses of property and crops – after a delay in withdrawal of monsoon led to unseasonal heavy rainfall and damage of harvested crops such as cotton, sugarcane, gram and several fruit harvests. Official data shows that agricultural damage was witnessed over 700,000 hectares across 10 districts in central and western Maharashtra, and almost 89,000 hectares across 36 talukas in the Vidarbha region.But Maharashtra’s total cost incurred due to climate disasters for the year 2020 alone comes to a total of ₹13,000 crore, which includes at least another ₹4,000 crore spent toward fixing damaged roads, reinstating water supplies, refurbishing damaged power infrastructure and various other urban and rural infrastructure fixes, along with ex gratia payments made to victims of heat waves, cold waves and lightning strikes.
It also includes at least ₹568 crore that was spent on disaster relief after Cyclone Nisarga hit last June, along with about ₹912 crore that was spent on stormwater drains and flood mitigation projects in Mumbai alone. The Mumbai civic body also spent an additional ₹36 crore for building water-holding structures under the sponge city master plan, disaster management data shows.
This year, the state government has paid compensation of at least ₹227 crore directly to the victims of Cyclone Tauktae and Konkan floods, but the total cost of climate disasters in the ongoing calendar year is likely to be in excess of ₹11,500 crore (which is the strength of the relief package announced by the Maharashtra on August 2).

“We will have to wait and see how things pan out over the rest of the year. If there are unseasonal rains in October again and crop harvesting is affected, the total cost of climate related disasters will be higher than in 2020,” said the government official quoted above.
Even though experts were alarmed at the scale of these losses, they emphasized that the real cost of climate change-induced disasters are intangible.
“The government of Maharashtra, which at the very least is cognizant of emerging climate science, may have allotted ₹11,500 as relief to flood victims, but that will only make up for calculable losses and provide relief to the poorest of the poor. That compensation is necessary of course, but try and imagine for a second the larger economic losses that are incurred when hundreds of thousands of people cannot make it to work for a few days, and when thousands of businesses are forced to remain shut because of flooding. It is exponential when compared to the losses we calculate. The cost of our inaction against climate change will only increase unless we first learn to adapt to these emerging trends of extreme weather,” said Dr Anjal Prakash, research director at the Indian School of Business (ISB), and a lead author of the ongoing 6th Assessment Report of IPCC (where he is involved in the chapter on cities, settlements and key infrastructure)."
09/29/2019,2019,Mumbai,English,Times of India,"Mumbai: Five extremely heavy rain days in Monsoon 2019 alone, eight in past decade.","MUMBAI: The city recorded as many as five “extremely heavy” rain days this monsoon, when over 200mm of downpour lashed the city within a 24-hour span and disrupted daily life. The numbers are worrisome—and worthy of Swedish 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg’s attention— when one considers that the eight preceding “extremely heavy” rain days occurred over a stretched- out period of a decade, from 2009 to 2018. 
“The overall trend in the last decade shows an increase in extreme heavy rainfall events not only in Mumbai but all over the country, which is an impact of climate change,” said R V Sharma, former deputy director general of IMD Mumbai. 
Mumbai’s Monsoon 2019 began on an unusual note: Rains arrived in the city on June 25—one of the most delayed onset dates in 45 years—against the traditional deadline of June 10. Moreover, it has been characterized by unusual weather patterns—one day saw a downpour of 350mm—that have been discussed at several levels, including BMC commissioner Pravin Pardeshi’s office during “debriefing” sessions for civic engineers. 
Weather scientists say rains have been “hyperactive” in 2019 but aren’t sure if this is a one-off occurrence or could become a pattern. K S Hosalikar, deputy director-general (western region), IMD, has another observation: On the five “extremely heavy” rainfall days, the downpour was restricted to a few hours. For instance, the city got 200mm of rain in the six hours between 11.30pm and 5.30am on July 2. On September 4, around 121mm of rain was recorded between 8.30am and 11.30am. 
“Most rain received this year were either in the ‘very heavy’ or ‘extremely heavy’ rainfall categories. At a time when we are talking of climate change and global warming, the first thing to occur is the increase in precipitation and that too in short spells, which we are seeing happen now,” he said. 
It is to escape the flooding caused by such intense downpours that 66-year-old Surindra Khubchandani moved from his flat in Jay Bharat society, Khar, to 15th Road, Santacruz. “Here, floodwaters drain out faster,” he said. 
As not many Mumbaikars can move homes like Khubchandani, the BMC has held brainstorming sessions on how to work around these intense downpours. 
A special report on ‘Oceans and Cryosphere’ released by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that extreme sea level events that took place once in a century would occur every year by mid-century in several regions, increasing the risk of flooding in low-lying coastal cities. 
Akshay Deoras, a PhD student in the department of meteorology, University of Reading, UK, blamed “cyclonic circulations” around the city for the extremely heavy rainfall. Monsoon has been almost “hyperactive” this year, he said. 
Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Meteorology And Climate Change of Skymet Weather Services, concurred: “This year saw an extreme weather event every month.” 
In July, weather scientists noticed the building up of numerous weather systems affecting Maharashtra and particularly north Konkan (which includes Mumbai) and Goa. “Many low-pressure areas formed over the Bay of Bengal and traveled in the westerly direction while they usually travel northwest,” said Palawat. 
Former IMD official Sharma said while “breaks” in monsoon have been common, there was no long break this year. Sridhar Balasubramanian, associate professor, department of mechanical engineering and associate faculty IDP Climate Studies, IIT Bombay, said, “We cannot avoid extreme weather events but at least control the way water reaches the right source. Our cities are seeing increasing concretisation and that will affect the local cloud pattern. Soil is getting depleted and not able to hold the rainwater. The water therefore just runs down and unless the sun comes out, it evaporate.”"
03/21/2021,2021,Mumbai,English,Mumbai Mirror,"Maharashtra: Warmer conditions, extreme weather post 2033 to affect productivity of principal crops, says study","While farmers from Maharashtra continue to face massive crises due to unseasonal rains affecting their farm produce, warmer and extreme weather conditions post 2033 are likely to have a negative impact on agricultural food grains as well as cash crops in the state. 
The observation has been made in a study conducted by Rahul Todmal, the Assistant Professor of Geography at Vidya Pratishthan's ASC College in Baramati. 
The study titled - 'Future Climate Change Scenario over Maharashtra, Western India: Implications of the Regional Climate Model for the Understanding of Agricultural Vulnerability', is published in the peer-reviewed journal Springer Nature. 
Based on the projected climatic data for the period between 2015 and 2100, the study says that Maharashtra is very likely to experience considerably warmer conditions after 2033, whereas, parts of Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra will register significant warming (by 1 – 2.5 degree Celsius). 
The study indicated that the annual mean minimum temperatures are expected to rise significantly across 80 per cent of Maharashtra districts over the next five decades. 
Stating that parts of the Vidarbha Sub-division and the Western Ghats exhibit a significant increase in rainfall by 82–225 mm in the near future, the study says, ""Almost the entire state is very likely to experience a rise in Annual Mean Temperature (AMT) by 0.5–2.5 C up to 2050, except in the Bhandara and Osmanabad district and surrounding areas."" 
""The near-term future rise in AMT over Maharashtra is very likely to reduce the productivity of cereal as well as cash crops,"" it adds. 
Todmal noted that climatic changes are very likely to affect the productivity of principal crops such as sorghum, pearl millet, sugarcane, wheat, rice, and cotton and added, It will be a great challenge for agronomist and policymakers to formulate a judicial plan for sustainable agriculture."" 
Projected temperature and rainfall rise by 2050. 
""Productivity of traditional rain-fed crops (jawar, bajra, pulses) and irrigated cash crops (sugarcane, onion, maize etc.) will likely reduce with the rise in temperature,"" he stated. 
While the Bhandara, Gondia, Akola, Washim, Parbhani, Hingoli, and Yavatmal districts may register a significant rise in monsoon rainfall by 53–123 mm, pockets in Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, and Jalgaon districts are expected to undergo a notable increase in rainfall, without any spatial pattern, he observed. 
Speaking to Mirror Online, Todmal said, ""The climatic changes are inevitable for Maharashtra. It will not only affect the economy of the state by damaging our agriculture, the backbone of society, but also it has the potential to disturb the wellbeing of the state by causing farmers suicide in future."" 
The author of the paper also mentions that a future increase in AMT in the areas where the rainfall remains unchanged may aggravate the water scarcity problem, particularly in the semi-arid region of the state. 
""It’s time to alter the agricultural practices to tackle the food security challenge under the scenario of climate change,"" say Todmal. 
The study recommends that the Maharashtra government needs to consider these environmental changes while formulating policies regarding agricultural and water resources."

05/01/2023,2023,Hyderabad,English,Deccan Cronicles,Experts blame climate change for intense rains in Hyderabad,"HYDERABAD: The unseasonal downpours and hailstorms that wreaked havoc in the state over the last week, disrupting normalcy and damaging standing crops, were attributed to factors such as weather systems and cyclonic circulations.

Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet Weather, told Deccan Chronicle that there was a series of five weather systems in April, which was unusual because their intensity and frequency start to decline in April.

""Additionally, new, fresh disturbances are developing over the Western Himalayas, and individual cyclonic circulations are also in progress,"" he informed.

Further, a north-south ‘trough’ has been persisting for several days, sometimes from Vidarbha or eastern Madhya Pradesh to south Tamil Nadu, passing over Telangana, he explained. ""As a result, rain activities are particularly severe in Telangana,"" he added.

The trough was likely to oscillate and bring intense rains in the next two days in the state. The intensity of hailstorms was observed to be very high across the country during March and April.

""As a result of climate change, intense weather events are on the rise, and unpredictable weather has become the norm. Over Northwest India, hail storms are increasing while dust storms are decreasing. Hailstorms were not common in central and southern India, but these regions are also experiencing such weather conditions,"" Palwat added.

Weather activities are expected to decrease in the following two days, according to experts, but there will be on and off rains throughout the month of May, with maximum temperatures ranging between normal and below normal.

Climate change and the urban heat island effect, according to environmentalist Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka, are two significant factors of the unexpected rains in the state, particularly in urban areas.

""These summer rains are convection current related thunder showers. Hailstorms occur as the convection currents push the clouds too high, when the ground is extremely heated. Pollution and dust are causing heavy rains in the urban phenomenon known as the heat island effect. It occurs when the average temperature in the urban region is higher than in the peri-urban and rural areas, which is mostly responsible for the incessant and intense rains in the city,"" explained Bhaskar Reddy.

However, such extreme and unexpected weather conditions would become more common in the future, experts warned.

Bhaskar Reddy informed that it was critical to reduce carbon footprints, conserve water bodies, adopt methods to lessen greenhouse effects, and grow useful trees in order to mitigate urban heat.

10/19/2021,2021,Hyderabad,English,The news Minute,"Climate change is here, and increasing microbursts in Hyderabad are proof","Written by :Rajeswari Parasa
Published on : 
19 Oct 2021, 1:37 am
This story is among several stories from TNM that will highlight the inundation, flooding and other consequences of heavy rains in Hyderabad. TNM hopes to draw attention to these issues, which have now become perennial in many areas of the city, by talking to experts, officials and more.

On the night of October 8 this year, Hyderabad recorded heavy rainfall of about 100 mm in the span of a couple of hours in parts of the city including Secunderabad, Saidabad, Moosapet and Saroornagar, among others. Climatologists say that this amount of rainfall is usually spread over a span of a day or two. Describing this as ‘microbursts’ or ‘mini’ cloudbursts, they say the city is facing the impact of the phenomenon due to global warming and climate change.

A cloudburst is defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) as intense rainfall measuring 100 mm per hour over a localised area, not exceeding 20-30 square kilometers. While some meteorologists have suggested that receiving more than 50 mm of rainfall in a span of two hours may be called a mini cloudburst or microburst, there is no clear definition of this weather phenomenon. Moreover, IMD has said that forecasting such cloudbursts is far from easy, given the highly localised nature of these weather events.

Change in rainfall pattern
According to data from a report titled ‘Weather and Climatology in Telangana’ from the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS), the high-intensity rainfall phenomenon is recent and has increased in the last two decades.

If we observe the occurrence of highest rainfall in a 24-hour period in Hyderabad in the last hundred years, four out of five highest rain events were reported in the last two decades. While Hyderabad and its surrounding districts, including Rangareddy, Medchal and Malkajgiri, received the record highest rainfall in a 24-hour period – 431.8 mm – from September 1908, this was followed by 241.5 mm in Begumpet on August 24, 2000, 226.8 mm in Saroornagar on July 21, 2012, 230.2 mm in Quthbullapur on September 21, 2016 and 300 mm in Hayathnagar on October 10, 2020.

Hyderabad city itself witnessed the top three spots of highest rainfall in 24 hours in the rains that wreaked havoc in October 2020. On one day – October 14, 2020 – 258.3 mm rainfall was recorded in Musheerabad, 252.4 mm in Saidabad and 248.3 mm in Bandlaguda.

What climatologists say
Mahesh Palawat, Chief Meteorologist from independent weather agency Skymet, says these extreme weather events are likely to increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change and global warming. “Now the air is warming up due to an increase in global temperatures. So the capacity to carry moisture is also higher, which leads to microbursts and intense thundercloud development, which usually leads to intense rainfall or heavy downpours for two to three hours,” he says.

Elaborating on microbursts, Mahesh says, “Microbursts have been observed for the last 4-5 years and we’re going to see more of it in the next 10-12 years.”

Mahesh points out that extreme weather events have increased significantly due to climate change and global warming. He explains, “The rainfall pattern has also changed. Earlier it used to be uniform rainfall, now heavy rainfall in short duration is more common. Heavy rains have decreased but the intensity has increased. Microbursts have also increased, the amount of rainfall that used to occur in the span of two to three days is now occurring in 24 hours or sometimes even 5-6 hours.”

Meteorologists also say that weather systems developing over the Bay of Bengal have changed in recent times, and this in turn is impacting Telangana. “The occurrence of extreme weather events has increased in Hyderabad. The weather system developing over the Bay of Bengal used to travel in a north-westerly direction earlier – across Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, sometimes over Uttar Pradesh. Now it is taking westerly trends, over Odisha, Telangana and Vidarbha. That’s why the intense rain activity has also increased in Telangana, particularly during the monsoon season. And the rain activity is not limited to July, August and September, it also extends into October and November,” he explains. 

IMD Hyderabad Centre Director K Nagaratna agrees that the city has been seeing a change in the rainfall pattern. “Yes, the rains in October 2021 were microbursts, but we could not do proper research due to lack of manpower. For the last few years, we have been observing rainfall of short duration and high intensity. More studies need to be done in this regard,” says Nagaratna.

Causes of climate change specific to Hyderabad
Environmentalists who have been doing studies in the city over the years say that the rapid urbanisation and growing population alongside pollution are some of the main reasons for the changes in the weather.

Hyderabad-based environmentalist BV Subba Rao points out that the city has witnessed rapid concretisation in the last two decades and the fastest growth was observed in the last 10-12 years. However, he adds that the development happened without any regulations or restrictions over which area should be developed, what kind of buildings should come up, and what material should be used. This, he adds, resulted in a lot of violations.

This rapid, unregulated growth has resulted in Hyderabad flooding after short, intense spells of rainfall. “On one side is unregulated concrete development, on the other side is the shrinkage of open spaces, parks and lakes. The lakes, which regulate the microclimate and keep the surroundings cool, have been lost over a period of time. More than 50% of lakes are now gone. So, the net result is that the city has become a radiation pocket, so more the radiation, more the water evaporates and the area becomes a vacuum. It sucks the clouds, especially rain-bearing clouds, so that’s why we’re experiencing these sudden outbursts,” Subba Rao explains.

Subba Rao notes that last week Secunderabad received 70 mm of rain in one hour, so the trend is changing to sudden outbursts of rain in pockets. “The outbursts of rains are in certain pockets, one day in Secunderabad, one day in Malakpet, so we’re not experiencing widespread rain, the trend is changing to high-intensity, short duration rainfall,” he says.

But in these circumstances, the environmentalist wonders whether the city is prepared, as there are not enough lakes to receive all that water, which is resulting in many areas getting submerged and inundated under flash floods.

Syed Azeem Unnisa, Professor at the Department of Environmental Sciences in Osmania University, Hyderabad, points out that the city’s growing population is also adding to our climate woes. “The population in the city is growing exponentially and the space is shrinking. As a result, more new buildings are coming up to accommodate them, more vehicles are being used for transport. A lot of pollutants are being released into the atmosphere, be it carbon dioxide or methane from industries or vehicular pollution. The state should bring in measures to curb the same.”

Subba Rao adds, “The rapid urbanisation going on in Hyderabad is establishing heat pockets. Even while it’s raining, the temperatures are not cool, so that is a change in the typical Hyderabad weather. Probably similar changes are happening in other cities like Bengaluru, Pune and Nagpur among others. Despite these unfortunate changes, the Urban Planning Department does not seem to have learnt anything. We do not have experts, especially in hydrology, climatology and other related fields, set up in the Department. So how can the administration plan when they are not equipped at all? The only manpower they have are those who go and open manholes whenever it rains. This is the greatest skill our people exhibit in the midst of a crisis!”

Can the city tolerate more rains? What can be done?
Subba Rao says, “The importance of water bodies like lakes becomes much more relevant in cities now. The kind of havoc Hyderabad has faced in the last three years due to the high-intensity rains is unprecedented. There is a need to study, analyse and understand the change in rainfall and reorient the water management in the city to make it suitable for living.”

Subba Rao, who has studied rainfall data for the last 30 years, says that the incidence of cloudbursts and microbursts is increasing. During the October 2020 rains itself, there were seven to eight localised cloudbursts in Hyderabad.

Anant Maringanti, Executive Director of city-based research and action initiative Hyderabad Urban Labs, points out that a Special Cell headed by a designated Lakes Commissioner was recently formed to protect the 185 lakes and water bodies in Hyderabad. “The Lakes Commissioner has to know what is happening by working with various departments and initiate measures accordingly. Wherever there could be floods and inundation, the authorities should first identify those hotspots and find the reasons. They should work with people to bring in change, local residents will know what the problem is. If my house is inundated, I’ll try to find its cause,” Ananth says."
08/11/2021,2021,Hyderabad,English,Times of India, EPTRI to release mandal-level projections for climate change,"HYDERABAD: Telangana State Climate Change Centre at Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPRTI), Hyderabad, is preparing mandal-wise climate change projections for the first time. 

The climate change projections at the local level have gained significance in the wake of UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which discovered that the global surface temperature was 1.09C higher in 2011-20 over the previous decade.

EPTRI said the mandal-wise reports would be released in the next six months. Telangana State Climate Change Action Plan was last prepared in 2015 following which the Haritha Haram and Mission Kakatiya programmes were taken up to decrease carbon emission and restore water bodies.

“Being a nodal agency for climate change studies, we are preparing a state action plan. From 2009, we had a national plan with eight missions. In 2012, (united) AP action plan was prepared, and in 2015 we did it for Telangana after state formation. After the (CO-P21) Paris agreement (limit global warming), states were asked for revised action plans. Currently, we are working on a state-level action plan,” said EPTRI climate change division scientist, Dr J Sesha Srinivas.

Along with Icrisat, EPTRI is working on district and mandal-level risk and vulnerability assessment of agriculture due to climate change. ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture had in 2019 prepared district-level risk and vulnerability assessments. 
“Mandal-wise climate change projections and risk studies will help come out with local adaptation strategies,” Sesha Srinivas added.
With the assistance of Icrisat and Professor Jayashankar Agricultural University, EPTRI has been carrying on agriculture mitigation projects in Mahabubnagar, Nagarkurnool and Wanaparthy districts. EPTRI has also tied up with the forest department to develop 11 reserve forest blocks in seven districts, where degraded forests were converted into dense forests."
10/14/2020,2020,Hyderabad,English,Down to Earth,"Telangana’s heavy showers have sure shot imprint of climate change
","The unusually excessive rainfall that Telangana has received since October 13, 2020 may have been due to global warming.
The main cause of the rainfall is a deep depression which de-intensified into a depression and currently lies over north interior Karnataka and some nearby areas of Maharashtra and Telangana, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
IMD predicts that the intensity of the system will further decrease to a low pressure area by the evening of October 14. A deep depression is a cyclonic circulation that carries a lot of rainfall and has moderate wind speeds just less than a cyclone.
The current system had formed as a low pressure area in the Andaman Sea. It then intensified into a depression and a deep depression, all the while moving in a north-north westward direction.
It finally took a westward turn towards the Andhra Pradesh coast and crossed over in the early morning hours of October 13, with wind speeds of 55-65 kilometres per hour (kmph), gusting to 75 kmph.
When such systems intensify into cyclones and make landfall along coasts, they de-intensify much quickly, which means that interior regions do not get much affected.
But global warming is making cyclonic systems all over the planet which includes hurricanes and typhoons much more dangerous as they carry more rainfall than before.
This is mainly because warmer air can carry more moisture than colder air. More moisture translates to more rainfall in cyclonic systems. The increase in rainfall can be calculated with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation which says that for every one degrees celsius (°C) rise in temperature the atmosphere can hold seven per cent more moisture.
With global warming projections of up to 5°C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this could translate to an increase of 35 per cent in moisture content of atmospheric systems by the end of the century.
What makes the situation scarier in the case of cyclonic systems is that the increase in moisture content of cyclones does not simply follow the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, creating possibilities for many more deluges in different parts of the world that are affected by cyclonic systems, according to a research paper published in the journal Earth’s Future in May 2018.
This is because “the convergence of moisture into a storm not only leads to higher precipitation but also, for certain storms, greater intensity and growth”, writes Kevin Trenberth, lead author of the paper and climate scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in the United States.
So, both warmer air and water affect the cyclones making the interactions much more complicated. The unprecedented intensity of the rainfall in Telangana is perhaps an evidence of this impact of global warming on cyclonic systems.
That is a trend that is only going to increase in the future if anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are not brought under control, according to the IPCC.
Flooded state
Telangana received a weighted average of 25.2 millimetres (mm) of rain October 13, 18 times the normal rainfall it receives at this time of the year, according to data from IMD. The rainfall had been going on for the past three days with some breaks.
Many parts of capital Hyderabad have flooded due to the rainfall. Many observers have claimed that they have never witnessed such rainfall in their lifetimes.
Fifteen people have lost their lives in rain-related incidents in the city in the last two days, according to media reports. The city, as a whole, received 37.3 mm absolute rainfall October 13, which is 18 times the normal for this time of the year.
Many places inside the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits such as Singapur township received 320 mm of rainfall October 13. Hayathnagar also received 290 mm of rainfall during the day.
This is only the second time that such high rainfall has been recorded in the GHMC areas according to IMD.
Other places in the main parts of the city such as Osmania University and Begumpet also received high rainfall, recording 250 mm and 210 mm rainfall respectively. Eleven other stations in the state have received rains in excess of 200 mm October 13.
If one looks at the individual districts of Telangana, the situation becomes scarier as many of them are arid and do not receive such intense rainfall even during the monsoon season.
All districts, 33 in total, except one, have received large excess rainfall October 13, with excesses ranging from 297 per cent in Kumaram Bheem to 5,242 per cent in Malkajgiri. Only Jogulamba Gadwal district had a deficit rainfall of four per cent.
In terms of absolute rainfall, Khammam district received 79.8 mm, which was the highest in the state. Between the mornings of October 13 and October 14, many places in the state were lashed by torrential rainfall. For instance, Singapur township received the maximum absolute rainfall of 320 mm."
07/19/2022,2022,Hyderabad,English,Times Now,Hyderabad reports no bad air quality days with AQI less than 200 from 2019-21; Ministry of Climate Change,"Hyderabad: According to the most recent Parliamentary report from the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change, Hyderabad reported zero bad days with the AQI of less than 200. Visakhapatnam had 25 bad days with the Air Quality Index (AQI) of less than 200, Amravati had 21 bad days, and Rajahmundry had 20 bad days in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. 
Every day of the year from 2019 to 2021, Hyderabad's AQI was below 200, showing that the city's air pollution has been kept in check and good air quality has been maintained. 
Although the data may appear to be good news for people in Hyderabad, environmental experts disagree with it when it comes to the air pollution in both Telugu-speaking states. 
In contrast, Visakhapatnam experienced a string of unfavourable days over the course of three years: 25 in 2019, 23 in 2020, and 21 in 2021. 
According to the research, Amaravati experienced 21 bad air days in 2019, 11 in 2020, and 8 in 2021 while Rajahmundry had 20 in 2019, 15 in 2020, and 9 in 2021. 
City environmentalist D. Narsmiha Reddy questions the reliability of the data's source in the parliamentary report. He spoke, “The source of information seems to be very shady as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) tell a different story about the AQI of the cities in question. As far as Hyderabad is concerned, the pollution level went down during the lockdown, but has worsened again after the lockdown was lifted.” 
He listed the three main sources of air pollution as being cars, factories, and construction, and stated that any city with these activities would continue to have bad AQI. 
For Andhra Pradesh he added, “Visakhapatnam is undergoing extensive construction activities, owing to which the AQI is bad there. Moreover, the public transport in the city is also poor, because of which lots of private vehicles are in use.”"
10/15/2020,2020,Hyderabad,English,Times of India,"Hyderabad rains another example of extreme weather changes striking India 
","NEW DELHI: The October 13 flash floods in Telangana and Andhra is a pointer to how extreme weather events are striking India with rising frequency. The UN office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UINDRR), in its latest study, found that Asia accounted for 41% of all floods worldwide, and 93% of all affected people (by floods) between 2000 and 2019. India, it says, is second worst affected after China with 17 floods every year, compared to China’s 20.The report points to governance issues largely behind huge flood-related casualties as resilient infrastructure — dams, dykes and drainage systems — can significantly contribute to preventing severe impact on population. The study has found 345 million Indians affected by floods between 2000 and 2019. India’s June 2013 flood has been recorded as the worst flood in the last two decades with 6,054 deaths, followed by the May 2004 floods in Haiti where 2,665 people lost their lives and Pakistan's 2010 floods with 1,985 casualties. “Many of these impacts are preventable since flooding, unlike most types of disasters, has affordable mechanisms of primary prevention, such as dams, dykes and drainage systems,” the UNDRR report observed. 
Mami Mizutori, the head of UNDRR, said investing in prevention and risk mitigation is the only way to reduce economic losses and loss of lives. “Good disaster risk governance depends on political leadership and delivery on the promises made when the Paris agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction were adopted five years ago,” she said. 
The report found that in the last 20 years, major floods have more than doubled from 1,389 (during 1980-1999) to 3,254 (during 2000-2019). The other climate change related disasters such as storms have hit more frequently, increasing from 1,457 incidents to 2,034 during the same period. 
In its study report — Human cost of disasters, an overview of the last 20 years — the UNDRR has found major increases in other categories of climate related disasters, including drought, wildfires and heatwaves, besides a rise in the geophysical events earthquakes and tsunamis. Earthquakes have caused maximum loss of lives, accounting for 58% of all deaths while floods and storms together accounted for 25% of all disaster deaths in the last 20 years. A similar UNDRR study in 2018 estimated India’s economic losses at $80 billion between 1998 and 2017. The actual losses were much higher as many of the disasters and their impact on the economy have never been recorded, it said. 
India has been ranked among the world's top five countries in absolute economic losses. Globally, disaster losses during this period have been estimated at $3 trillion. These losses have increased by more than 120% in the last 20 years compared to the preceding two decades (1978-1997). And if we just account for climate related disaster losses, they have gone up by more than 151%."
08/27/2022,2022,Hyderabad,English,Scrolls newsletter,"As Hyderabad grapples with extreme rainfall and floods, it should draft a long-term mitigation plan","In the 2022 monsoon season, July turned out to be the wettest month in the city of Hyderabad. The city, the joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states recorded excess rainfall of 144.2 millimetres against the average of 38.1 millimetres.

The rainfall was particularly heavy during the week of July 6-13, with torrential rains lashing almost the entire Hyderabad and its outskirts. From June 1, starting with the pre-monsoon showers the city received a high of 511 mm rainfall upto August 1, which is 218 millimetres higher than the average for the entire monsoon season, according to data from the Telangana State Development Planning Society.

The volume of rainfall on July 26, ranged between 6 centimetres and 10 centimetres in just two hours around midnight. It left people in several areas struggling with water logging, inundation, overflowing drains. Fluctuating power and outages further aggravated the situation.

Homes were flooded with rainwater and sewerage mixed and thousands of people in areas such as Padma Colony of Chaderghat, Ayyappa Colony in Nagole, Kodandaram Nagar and Saraswathi Nagar in Saroornagar, and certain locations of Malakpet, LB Nagar and Dilsukhnagar, were affected.

Usually, September was the month when the city received heavy rainfall. But in recent years, heavy rainfall has been occurring at any time in the southwest monsoon season from June to September.

Among the worst extreme weather events in the city in recent years was the record-breaking rainfall (192 millimetres during October 13-14) and consequent floods in October 2020, which left nearly 50 dead and destruction estimated around Rs 5,000 crore.

Hyderabad and neighbouring areas have reported extreme rainfall spells of between 15 and 24 centimetres in a single day on four occasions in the last decade – July 2012, September 2016, September 2019 and October 2020.

Before that, the heaviest downpour was 24 centimetres in 24 hours in August 2000. With this increasing frequency of episodes of extreme rainfall, the river Musi, considered nearly dead has come alive and started to overflow at some point and submerging low lying areas.

While extreme weather changes continue on one hand, on the other, Hyderabad city continues to grow rapidly. Specially over the last two decades, with high rise corporate and residential buildings, flyovers, the metro rail and upcoming ring roads bring with them, arise in traffic, population and waste generation.

Cyberabad, the area of Hyderabad which hosts major global technology companies, has has large residential complexes but not a well-planned drainage system, according to experts.

This urbanisation and transformation, though impressive in external appearance has neither been very planned nor with a definite vision. Consequently, Hyderabad is fast losing its natural courses of rainwater drainage system that were the cornerstone of a visionary plan by engineer Mokshagundem Vishveswarayya in the early 20th century.

Moved by the large scale destruction and death of thousands in the September 1908 Musi river floods, the Nizam Osman Ali Khan had specially sought and got the engineer to formulate a long term plan. As per the plan, two large reservoirs, Osmansagar and Himayathsagar were created in 1911.

A network of storm water drains were connected and the dozens of lakes supplemented in ensuring that the rainwater did not flood any areas of human habitation but ran their course into the river.

Climate change effect
The impact of climate change is manifesting in the form of an increase in the episodes, and in some cases intensity, of extreme weather incidents, especially heavy rainfall in cities across India.

“Both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea which influence cyclonic and other atmospheric events have witnessed a rise in warming over the decades. This in turn is triggering cyclones, floods and heavy rainfall across the central and south India covering over 50,000 sq kms,” says Raghu Murtugudde, a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, and Emeritus Professor at the University of Maryland in the United States.

“The erratic distribution of rainfall during the southwest monsoon period is also due to global warming. Instances of heavy downpour of over 150 mm per day are typically characterised as ‘extreme rainfall events’,” he explained.

“The SW [southwest] monsoon is also pronouncedly effected by El Niño or La Niña factors. This year the latter has been strong from May and the rainfall fluctuations can be attributed to it,” says K Ashok, a professor at the Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Hyderabad.

According to the India Meteorological Department, 2022 has seen the second highest occurrence of extreme weather events in the last 100 years. In March, the country experienced the highest temperatures in some parts of north India.

While in cities, these weather events take a toll on urban infrastructure, business and everyday life, in rural areas the changes in the rainfall patterns could have a long term impact on the farming operations during the kharif season, especially in those areas dependent on monsoon rains only."

11/11/2022,2022,Chennai,English,BBC news,Chennai rains: Can the city withstand another urban flood?,"Seven years after devastating floods killed more than 400 people in the southern Indian city of Chennai, the region is witnessing severe rains that are becoming harder to predict. BBC Tamil's K Subagunam finds out if the city is equipped to deal with the impact of changing weather patterns.
Schools and colleges have been shut in Chennai for the second time in November after heavy rains lashed the city on Friday.
Videos showed people wading through muddy waters which flooded the streets and residential areas of the coastal city of 12 million people.
Authorities are on high alert as more heavy rains are expected in the coming days.
The deluge comes just 10 days after the city recorded its heaviest rainfall in more than 30 years on 1 November.
At least 26 people have died in rain-related incidents since 31 October.
Experts say the rains have not only become more frequent but also more unpredictable, making it hard for authorities to respond rapidly.
""No one could have predicted that the city would receive 140mm of rainfall in 24 hours right at the onset of the monsoon season earlier this month,"" says Dr S Janakarajan, the president of South Asia Consortium for Interdisciplinary Water Resources Studies.
""It was an unexpected weather event where forecasts changed from morning to evening.""
The state authorities tried to control the situation by bringing out motor pumps to clear waterlogged areas and sending its relief teams to flood-affected neighbourhoods.
But as sea levels rise and heat waves intensify, experts say the city will need to do a lot more to mitigate the impact of extreme weather conditions in the future and to avoid a repeat of the deadly floods in 2015.
""The fact that water entered people's homes at the very beginning of the monsoon season shows just how unprepared Chennai is this time,"" says SA Haris Sultan, a member of anti-corruption watchdog Arappor Iyakkam based in the city.
Located on the coast of Tamil Nadu state, Chennai is one of the largest cities in India.
The city is also a hub for industrial production and automobile manufacturing.
Unlike a majority of India - which depends on southwest monsoon in June for rains - the months of October and November are the primary monsoon season for Chennai.
The city depends on the rains to manage its water needs during the summer months.
In 2019, the city witnessed a severe drought and was forced to bring in 10 million litres of water per day from other districts to mitigate the crisis.
But geographically, Chennai lies on a low-lying plain - with most parts of the city just two to five metres above sea level.
In its latest report, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) named Chennai as one among 20 coastal cities in the world that are expected to face major flood damage by 2050.
A lead author of the report warned the city would face a ""double whammy of heat and humidity, and cyclones"" as temperatures rapidly rise in South Asia.
To prepare for the monsoon season this year, the local government carried out an ambitious project to build storm water drains - which would collect excess rains from the streets and drain them into the sea.
But within three days of heavy rains in the first week of November, the city was entirely flooded, bringing life to a standstill.
Climate scientist Dr Roxy Mathew Koll says the city faltered in dealing with the situation because of the increasingly erratic nature of monsoons.
""We now have short episodes of strong wind bursts and heavy rains which are less predictable and challenging to even monitor, let alone forecast,"" he says.
Others experts say that the city's current drainage system and groundwater structures are inadequate to stop widespread waterlogging and to store rainwater for summers.
""Most of Chennai has become buildings and roads,"" says L Elango, a professor of geology at the city's Anna University.
Over the past decade, Chennai has witnessed large-scale construction and rapid industrialisation - much of which has grown without a plan and with no regard to water flows, and without anticipating extreme weather events.
According to data from the State Planning Commission, more than 80% of land is under construction in the city.
Prof Elango says that building massive storm water drains and groundwater recharge structures offer little benefit, as Chennai's concrete topography prevents water from going underground.
""Instead, the city's administration should focus on integrating drainage systems of buildings and streets to connect them to reservoirs,"" he says.
Increasing frequency of the rains has also meant that forecasting agencies and disaster response forces have less time to respond to the crisis.
""Cyclones that used to take two to four days to develop from a weak storm to an extremely severe cyclone are now intensifying in less than a day's time,"" Dr Koll says.
That's why, he adds, the government needs to formulate long-term policies that ""help coastal communities adapt to intensifying storms and rising sea levels"".
""We might need to redesign cities to create more open spaces and take measures for the flood water to sink.""
Prof Janakarajan agrees - he says the city needs to construct more rooftop structures to harvest rainwater and store it underground.
""If that is done, Chennai will not only be flood-resilient but also drought-resilient."""
08/06/2019,2019,Chennai,English,CNBC,Rapid growth of India Chennai threatened by water shortages,"CHENNAI, India (AP) — Dozens of billion-dollar companies. Thousands of high-paying IT and manufacturing jobs. Luxury apartments towering over the Bay of Bengal. The southern Indian city of Chennai has one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, but it’s out of water, threatening to put a brake on all that growth.

In Chennai, a coastal city of about 10 million and the capital of Tamil Nadu state, rapid development and rampant construction have overtaxed a once-abundant natural water supply, forcing the government to spend huge sums to desalinate sea water, bring water by train from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away and deploy an army of water trucks to people whose household taps have suddenly run dry.

The water shortfall is disrupting business at all levels, from the gleaming, 45-kilometer (28-mile) IT Corridor to the neighborhood tea shop. Some workers have been asked not to report to the office while others have had to give up a day’s wages to wait for the erratic water truck that makes daily deliveries.

The Madras Chamber of Commerce, named for what British colonialists called the city, said that results from a survey sent to its 700 members in May found that most industries in the city’s diversified economy have been affected by the crisis, which has caused disruptions in production schedules, higher operation costs and a reluctance to invest in expansion because of the uncertainty about future water supplies.

Companies are paying 30% more for private supplies sourced from farther outside Chennai and delivered by water tankers, which require dedicated workers to manage. Others have set up their own water-recycling systems, said chamber Secretary-General K. Saraswathi.

“Buying water in tankers cannot be depended (upon) and is not sustainable,” Saraswathi said. “Small-capacity desalination plants along with supply of tertiary treated water have to be taken up on war footing.”

Most of India suffering from drought
The country has received 16 percent less rainfall than it normally receives since Jan 6.

Receiving about 80% of its annual rainfall in two months, October and November, Chennai is naturally prone to droughts and floods, exacerbated in recent years by climate change. But some of the disaster is manmade.

Chennai’s population has more than tripled in three decades. And like many cities across India, in a drive to develop, the Chennai Municipal Corporation has changed zoning to permit building over filled-in ponds and canals and on flood plains, which means the monsoon season’s copious rainfall isn’t absorbed to recharge groundwater supplies.

Organized water distribution in Chennai dates to British rule in the 1870s.

At Red Hills Lake, a lone fisherman casts a line into a shallow pool — all that remains of the 4,500-acre (1,820-hectare) reservoir. Elsewhere, sheep graze and bulldozers fill truckloads of sand from the dry lakebed. Red Hills and the three other rain-fed reservoirs that are meant to supply the bulk of Chennai’s water have been left without “a single drop of water,” Edappadi Palaniswami, Tamil Nadu’s chief minister, said in June.

He said about 9,800 water truck trips were being made daily to supply drinking water in Chennai, but that his office had been flooded with requests from apartment owners for more.

On the trash-strewn banks of the Cooum River, one of half a dozen natural waterways in the city, bulldozers level the earth for a new high-rise on one side while a small community of tin-roofed shacks rely upon a hand pump for their daily water needs. Because sewage treatment capacity is far below sewage generated, the city’s rivers and canals are filled with raw waste.

Nearby, Sonalal Saw, 24, takes an auto rickshaw to a public tap under a metro rail overpass every four or five days to fill more than a dozen 50-liter (13-gallon) jugs for his tea shop. As Saw loads up the vehicle, a steady stream of people arrive at the tap, carrying water jugs on wagons attached to bicycles or balanced with rope on motorcycles.

Behind the tap is one of the metro board’s distribution centers. Trucks contracted by the city fill up tankers to deliver to residential areas, including Royapettah, a busy working-class neighborhood where a line of women with colorful plastic jugs wait in line for the truck’s arrival.

The trucks have been coming nearly every day for a month, often several times a day, but the schedule is erratic, residents say, forcing them to forego work waiting for water delivery.

As he helped his neighbors fill their jugs, tailor Syed Ansarbasha, 40, said that development was to blame for the crisis.

“The rainwater which flows into the lakes, those lakes now have houses, factories (constructed on them),” he said. Where will the water go when it rains now? That’s why we have water problem,” he said.

This is the first time Royapettah resident Rasheeqa Sheriff, 15, has experienced water scarcity in her young life. Her family’s three-story apartment building has always had running taps — a luxury that she said continuously astounded her grandparents, who saw it as a sign of Chennai’s modernity and India’s great progress.

“I feel like, wait, have we gone back in time?” said Sheriff, who aspires to be a barrister like her father.

“The thing is, we didn’t take care of the rivers, canals. We are responsible, but nobody’s ready to take this blame. Everyone’s blaming the government. Come on, blame yourselves,” she said.

Evidence of growth and development is everywhere in Chennai. A brand new apartment complex in the western outskirts called Golden Opulence hung a banner advertising big capital letters: “Drinking water in abundance, absolutely free!” Nearby, Ford and Hyundai factories assemble cars and IT companies including Foxconn, the Taiwanese purveyor of the iPhone, build gadgets for India’s growing electronics export business.

Water also flows more freely in richer south Chennai, where upscale hotels with swimming pools, shopping malls with fountains, high-end apartment buildings and restaurants purchase their water from private sources.

Chennai’s Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board is delivering about 500 million liters (132 million gallons) of water per day — less than half of the city’s needs. It’s supplementing its supplies with water brought by rail from a dam hundreds of kilometers (miles) away. It is also planning a third desalination plant.

“Shiny new investments may always be required for large-scale water supply systems, but we all need to increase the focus on the efficient use and management of our water too,” said Vivian Castro-Woolridge, an urban affairs specialist at the Asian Development Bank who runs a project to improve Chennai’s climate change resiliency.

“It’s not an optimal use of limited financial resources to put more water into any system without also ensuring proper network management, active leak management programs and skilled staff to minimize water losses,” she said.

To be sure, the problem isn’t limited to Chennai. The National Institution for Transforming India, a government think tank, said in a report last year that India was undergoing the worst water crisis in its history. “Critical groundwater resources — which account for 40% of our water supply — are being depleted at unsustainable rates,” it said.

More than 600 million people are facing “acute” water shortages, and 21 Indian cities, including Chennai, are expected to run out of groundwater by 2020.

With the London-based consultancy Oxford Economics predicting all of the world’s 10-fastest growing cities in India, the implications globally could be significant.

The water crisis “raises the question of whether the infrastructure will be in place to support the growth. If not, then the consequence would probably be much slower growth,” said Richard Holt, the consultancy’s head of global cities research."
09/19/2022,2022,Chennai,English,NPR,"Climate change is here, and increasing microbursts in Hyderabad are proof","t is likely that climate change helped drive deadly floods in Pakistan, according to a new scientific analysis. The floods killed nearly 1500 people and displaced more than 30 million, after record-breaking rain in August.

The analysis confirms what Pakistan's government has been saying for weeks: that the disaster was clearly driven by global warming. Pakistan experienced its wettest August since the country began keeping detailed national weather records in 1961. The provinces that were hardest hit by floods received up to eight times more rain than usual, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

Climate change made such heavy rainfall more likely, according to the analysis by a group of international climate scientists in Pakistan, Europe and the United States. While Pakistan has sometimes experienced heavy monsoon rains, about 75 percent more water is now falling during weeks when monsoon rains are heaviest, the scientists estimate.

The analysis is a so-called attribution study, a type of research that is conducted very quickly compared to other climate studies, and is meant to offer policymakers and disaster survivors a rough estimate of how global warming affected a specific weather event. More in-depth research is underway to understand the many ways that climate change affects monsoon rainfall.

For example, while it's clear that intense rain will keep increasing as the Earth heats up, climate models also suggest that overall monsoon rains will be less reliable. That would cause cycles of both drought and flooding in Pakistan and neighboring countries in the future.

Such climate whiplash has already damaged crops and killed people across southeast Asia in recent years, and led to a water crisis in Chennai, India in 2019.

The new analysis also makes clear that human caused climate change was not the only driver of Pakistan's deadly floods. Scientists point out that millions of people live in flood-prone areas with outdated drainage in provinces where the flooding was most severe. Upgrading drainage, moving homes and reinforcing bridges and roads would all help prevent such catastrophic damage in the future."
06/21/2019,2019,Chennai,English,NYT Chennai,"Chennai, an Indian City of Nearly
5 Million, Is Running Out of Water","The water is almost gone.

Satellite photographs reveal the stark shrinking of one of the main rain-fed reservoirs that serves Chennai, one of the biggest cities in India.

In one image, taken by satellite on June 15 last year, the city’s largest reservoir, Lake Puzhal, resembles a dark blue ink-stain amid a densely crowded cityscape.

In another, taken on Sunday, exactly a year later, the lake is a small grey fraction of its former self.

One of the city’s other important reservoirs, the smaller Chembarambakkam Lake, is also running dry.

Chennai, a hot, muggy city on the Indian Ocean coast, should be in the throes of the monsoon by now. But the rains are late across India. And Chennai has received virtually none of the rain it should have seen by now."
08/28/2020,2020,Chennai,English,Times of India,Global warming to make Chennai monsoons severe,"CHENNAI: Incidents of knee-deep pools forming on Chennai streets during the northeast monsoon could become more common in the coming years if rising global temperatures are not brought under check.

A new study has found there could be a 5% increase in rainfall during the northeast monsoon between 2020 and 2049 and up to 21% between 2070 and 2099 over most parts of south peninsular India. This despite measures to control greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.

But if very little or no measures are taken and high emissions continue, northeast monsoon rainfall could rise by 11% by 2050 and by 38% before the end of the century.

The overall frequency and intensity of rainfall could increase and changes could start to become rapid by 2050; the highest 24-hour rainfall and consecutive five-day rainfall events could become intense; the number of consecutive dry days could reduce, but the number of very wet days could go up, the study observed.
Tamil Nadu receives nearly half of its annual rainfall while Chennai gets about 63% from the northeast monsoon which contributes to more than 30% in parts of Kerala, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema and south interior Karnataka. Much of the rain is from phenomena like depression.

The study was a collaborative work of Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (a ministry of earth sciences lab) along with National Institute of Technology, Rourkela and SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai. The findings came out of climate simulations and projections of 20 different global climate models from NASA Earth Exchange.

K Koteswara Rao from IITM, Pune said, ""Coastal regions and cities like Chennai will suffer due to increased local convection resulting in heavy rainfall as the air absorbs more moisture directly from the sea.""

The researchers said chances of regions like Chennai facing another 2015-like flooding scenario are more.

A red atlas developed in 2019 by city-based National Centre for Coastal Research showed that such low-lying old localities as Periamet, Pattalam, Kosapet, Manali, Thiruvottiyur, Chintadripet and Perumbur could go under 3ft-6ft of water if the city gets 30cm of rain in 24 hours, like in 2015. Many streets in west Chennai localities like Anna Nagar, Aminjikarai, Shenoy Nagar, Pallikaranai, Thoraipakkam and Madipakkam have high-risk of flooding.


Over the years, a warming of earth’s climate has caused extreme weather events. In 2019, eight cyclones brewed over the north Indian Ocean, while in May 2020, weather buoys in Bay of Bengal measured a record 32 deg C-34 deg C sea surface temperatures that eventually helped Cyclone Amphan become a category 5 storm in 18 hours.

While the study gave a picture over the entire south peninsular India, meteorologists said it may not hold good for all states. ""In 2017, only Tamil Nadu recorded poor monsoon rain while states like AP and Karnataka had good rain. There may be more such variations as you forecast over smaller regions. Right now, our forecast accuracy is only 60% to 70% for district level. The accuracy reduces to 50% at taluk level,"" said N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD.


""But this year, we expect a good northeast monsoon."""
12/26/2019,2019,Chennai,English,The Weather Channel,Rewind 2019: A Look Back at Significant Developments in Indian Science This Year,"Chandrayaan-2 may have dominated popular imagination during 2019 despite the Vikram Lander failing to soft-land on the lunar surface, but the year was marked by several significant developments by Indian scientists in fields ranging from nanotechnology to climate change.
The run-up to the lunar mission with planned landing of the lander-cum-rover, the launch campaign, the journey to the lunar orbit and the landing sequence all attracted national and international attention. The year ended in triumph for citizen science when Chennai-based software engineer, Shanmuga Subramanian, discovered debris of Vikram on the lunar surface using publicly available high-resolution images of the landing site. This development comes close to a rise in citizen science initiatives in the country.
Staying with space and astronomy, star of an exoplanet was named after Indian physicist, Bibha Chowdhury. During the year, Indian software engineers got readied software that will run the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), which is slated to be the world’s largest ground-based telescope operating at optical and infrared wavelengths. Details about TMT and other international Big Science projects in which India is participating were on display in a roving exhibition called Vigyan Samagam which attracted huge crowds.
Climate change: Responding to climate change impacts being seen in the Himalayan region, Indian scientists developed a common framework for assessment of climate change vulnerability in all the states in the region, using an index based on socio-economic factors, demographic and health status, sensitivity of agricultural production, forest-dependent livelihoods, and access to information, services and infrastructure. This knowledge will now be applied to develop a countrywide map of climate vulnerability.
Scientists from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) found a link between warming of the Indo-Pacific Ocean and changing rainfall patterns in many parts of the globe, including India. The warming pools of the Indo-Pacific Ocean are expanding, and this, in turn, is altering a major weather phenomenon known as the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). The warming of Indo-Pacific Ocean is occurring due to man-made emissions. Another group from the Indian Institute of Science warned that as many as 55 percent of glaciers in the Satluj basin may disappear by 2050. and 97 percent by 2090, under extreme climate change scenario. Using ice thickness of glaciers as the basis, scientists also estimated that glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas might contain 27% less ice than previously suggested.
Eco-friendly technologies: The year saw progress towards development of less polluting crackers, with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) releasing first set of ‘green crackers’. A national centre to pursue R&D in clean coal technologies was also opened in Bangalore. Eight teams of innovators from different parts of the world were selected for an international competition to develop more efficient and climate-friendly cooling solutions for residential buildings. The team will get seed money to translate their ideas into prototypes. The final winner of the Global Climate Prize will be announced in November 2020."
