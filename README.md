# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

Under the expert guidance of Professor Tony Diana, Ph.D. at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I delved into the sentiments expressed in news articles about climate change impacts in Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad.

Using advanced natural language processing techniques like TextBlob polarity scoring and a zero-shot classifier, we explored emotions, attitudes, and perspectives in 25 recent media reports from each city.

Our findings revealed interesting nuances â€“ Chennai's coverage was more optimistic, Mumbai demonstrated higher climate consciousness, and Hyderabad expressed more negative emotions. However, through statistical testing, we discovered that these differences were not statistically significant, suggesting considerable similarities in public opinions across regions.

As India faces escalating climate threats, understanding public sentiments becomes crucial for informed policymaking.
